# Session handoff

Read at the start of every Claude Code session and updated at the end. Captures work-in-progress context that wouldn't otherwise survive between sessions.

See `.claude/rules/session-handoff.md` for the protocol (4 KB size discipline + reader-side truncation defence).

## Current state

**Session 2026-05-22 — specs 077 + 078 both shipped & committed.** Branch `spec-077-product-validation-framing` (off `main`, **not pushed, not merged**), 4 commits.

- **077 — SHIPPED + COMMITTED** (`89d81f2`). `/product` step 4 renamed "UX Testing" → "Validation" (`git mv 04-ux-testing` → `04-validation`) + a new `contrast` quality-criterion on step 15b. Dogfooded in `/tmp`; `build-report.test.ts` 25/25. Spec `shipped`, 7/7 acceptance.
- **078 — SHIPPED + COMMITTED** (`857a2d9` scaffold + the `fix(078)` commit). Reworded the step-04 `findings` quality-criterion in `quality-checklist.md`: projected-mode audits are no longer false-failed for omitting the optional YAML frontmatter; measurable-mode audits still owe it. One-file fix. Dogfooded in `/tmp`: projected report → `findings: pass`, measurable report missing frontmatter → `findings: fail`. Spec `shipped`, 4/4 acceptance.
- **075** — task 14 still partial (carryover, untouched this session).

## WIP — resume point

**Nothing mid-flight.** Both 077 and 078 are shipped and committed. The branch `spec-077-product-validation-framing` carries both. Next session's first decision: push the branch + open a PR to `main`, or merge directly.

## Next steps

1. **Push `spec-077-product-validation-framing` + open a PR to `main`** (the branch carries both 077 and 078) — or merge directly.
2. **075 task 14** — full `/product` dogfood, last task before 075 ships (carryover).
3. **076** — founder must resolve OQ#8 before `/sdd plan`.
4. Dated reminders: 029 05-30 · 035 06-07 · 046 07-01 · 060 07-19.

## Decisions & gotchas

- **078 = a one-file fix.** Only `quality-checklist.md § 04`'s `findings` criterion was reworded; the YAML frontmatter stays `schema.md`-optional. The optional prompt/schema cross-reference was deliberately skipped (spec-075 principle — don't leak judge-awareness into producer-facing templates). See `078/notes.md`.
- **077 + 078 dogfood method** — representative slice: real `Agent` dispatches (step producers + the `04-validation` / `15b-hifi-mood` quality judges) against hand-built fixtures in an ephemeral `/tmp` project, not a full 15-step run. See `077/notes.md`, `078/notes.md`.
- **`secrets-scan` hook blocks compound `git add && git commit`** — run them as two separate Bash calls. `git commit -F-` heredoc works fine.
- **`governance-gate` blocks `rm -rf`** (combined `-r`+`-f`) — use `rm -r` without `-f`.

## Carryover (orthogonal — not touched this session)

- **075 task 14** — full `/product` dogfood pending (scenarios 3-6); pairs with the "069 live validation" reminder.
- **076 product-dogfood-fixes** — scaffolded, OQ#8 blocks `/sdd plan`.
- `docs/specs/074-subagent-personas/` — untracked draft (persona/role-prompting killed on research grounds; another session's WIP — leave it).
- `.claude/REMINDERS.md` items per startup readout.
