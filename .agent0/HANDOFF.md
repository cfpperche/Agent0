# Session handoff

Canonical runtime-neutral handoff for Agent0 sessions. Claude Code injects/nags through hooks; Codex receives the same handoff through tracked `.codex/hooks.json` after project/hook trust.

See `.agent0/context/rules/session-handoff.md` for the protocol, 4 KB size discipline, fallback behavior, and reader-side truncation defense.

## Current State

**Session 2026-06-04 — spec 148 `publish-boundary-closeout-check` closed.** The handoff-discipline meeting converged on a hook-backed fix for the recurring "section done but HANDOFF stale" failure. `SessionStart` now records `start-head`; `SessionStop` now has a clean publish-boundary branch: when session commits are pushed and the latest session commit does not touch `.agent0/HANDOFF.md`, it nags once to force a final handoff re-read/update.

Validation passed: `bash .agent0/tests/session-handoff/run-all.sh` (11/11), `bash .agent0/tests/session-handoff-multi-runtime/run-all.sh` (6/6), `bash .agent0/tests/harness-sync/run-all.sh` (40/40), `bash -n .agent0/hooks/session-start.sh .agent0/hooks/session-stop.sh .agent0/tests/session-handoff/11-publish-boundary-closeout.sh`, and `git diff --check`.

**Session 2026-06-04 — Codex `/video` skill-loader warning fixed locally.** Meeting investigation traced the startup warning to `.agent0/skills/video/SKILL.md` frontmatter: unquoted `argument-hint` contained `code: scaffold`, which strict YAML parses as invalid at column 46. The value is now quoted, and `/skill` validation rejects invalid YAML frontmatter before field extraction.

Validation passed: `bash -n .agent0/skills/skill/scripts/validate.sh`; `/skill` fixtures 9/9 including `invalid-yaml-colon-space`; `validate.sh` over every `.agent0/skills/*` skill (only existing body-size warning for `/skill`); PyYAML parse over every skill frontmatter; multi-runtime-skills 9/9; video tests 4 pass / 1 integration skip; `git diff --check` clean.

## Active Work

- No active Agent0 work is claimed. Spec 148 is complete and is being closed in the final publish-boundary handoff commit.

## Next Actions

Push the final spec 148 closeout commit. No implementation or validation step is currently pending.

## Decisions & Gotchas

- `assets/generated/.manifest.jsonl` is now local audit state, not durable project history.
- Do not add the manifest to `sync-harness.sh` copy lists; that would risk copying Agent0 prompt/cost history into consumers.
- `/video` policy is unchanged: `.video-manifest.jsonl` remains governed by `.agent0/context/rules/video-gen.md`.
- `argument-hint:` is still a top-level skill frontmatter field; values containing `: ` must be quoted or block-styled.
- Spec 148 intentionally does not parse handoff prose; the mechanical proof is that the latest pushed session commit touches `.agent0/HANDOFF.md`.
- Root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are Agent0-managed entrypoints; consumer-local Codex guidance still belongs in `AGENTS.override.md` or nested `AGENTS.md`.
